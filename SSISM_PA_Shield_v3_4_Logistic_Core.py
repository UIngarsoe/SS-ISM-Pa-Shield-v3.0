SSISM V Smart Advisor Framework Note:
The system is a philosophical, mathematical, and emotional defense system for cybersecurity,
founded on the principle of 'Doing Nothing as Value'.

CORE FUNCTION: MANDATORY LOCKOUT
The MANDATORY LOCKOUT command is designed to counteract social engineering by institutionalizing
delay, requiring a 24-hour verification protocol when the Digital Trust Score (Φ) is too low.
